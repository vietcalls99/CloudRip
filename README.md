# CloudRip

A tool that helps you find the real IP addresses hiding behind Cloudflare by checking subdomains. For penetration testing, security research, and learning how Cloudflare protection works.

## What it does

- **IPv4 & IPv6 support** - Resolves both A and AAAA records
- **Multiple IPs detection** - Finds ALL IPs behind a domain, not just the first one
- **Progress bar** - Real-time progress with live stats (found/cloudflare count)
- **Dynamic Cloudflare IP detection** - Fetches latest IP ranges from Cloudflare's API (with fallback)
- **Fast subdomain scanning** - Uses multiple threads to speed things up
- **Multiple wordlists** - Combine several wordlists in a single scan
- **Wordlist comments** - Use `#` to add comments in your wordlists
- **Multiple output formats** - Export to JSON, YAML, CSV, or plain text
- **Verbose & quiet modes** - Control output verbosity
- **Filters out Cloudflare IPs** - Only shows you the real server addresses
- **Bring your own wordlist** - Or use the built-in one (dom.txt)
- **Save your findings** - Export results to a file for later
- **Rate limiting** - Won't spam the target and get you blocked
- **Solid default wordlist** - Organized and comprehensive for better results

## Getting it running

You'll need Python 3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use it

Basic scan:
```bash
python3 cloudrip.py example.com
```

With all the options:
```bash
python3 cloudrip.py example.com -w wordlist1.txt -w wordlist2.txt -t 20 -o report.json -f json
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<domain>` | The site you're testing (like example.com) |
| `-w, --wordlist` | Wordlist file(s). Can be specified multiple times (default: dom.txt) |
| `-t, --threads` | How many threads to run (default: 10) |
| `-o, --output` | Save results to a file |
| `-f, --format` | Output format: `normal`, `json`, `yaml`, `csv` (default: normal) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show all results including "not found" entries |
| `-q, --quiet` | Minimal output - only show found IPs |

## Examples

**Basic scan:**
```bash
python3 cloudrip.py example.com
```

**Multiple wordlists with JSON output:**
```bash
python3 cloudrip.py example.com -w subs1.txt -w subs2.txt -o report.json -f json
```

**Fast scan with 50 threads:**
```bash
python3 cloudrip.py example.com -t 50 -o results.csv -f csv
```

**Verbose mode (see all attempts):**
```bash
python3 cloudrip.py example.com -v
```

**Quiet mode (only found IPs):**
```bash
python3 cloudrip.py example.com -q -o found.txt
```

## Version History

### v2.1.0 (Current)

**New Features:**
- Full IPv6 support (AAAA record resolution)
- Multiple IPs detection - Resolves ALL IPs behind a domain (A/AAAA records can return multiple IPs)
- Real-time progress bar with live stats
- Dynamic Cloudflare IP range fetching from official API
- Multiple output formats: JSON, YAML, CSV, normal text
- Multiple wordlists support (combine with `-w file1.txt -w file2.txt`)
- Verbose mode (`-v`) to see all results including not found
- Quiet mode (`-q`) for minimal output
- Automatic root domain checking before subdomain scan
- Comprehensive scan summary with statistics
- Structured report with categorized results (found, cloudflare, not_found, errors)
- Wordlist comment support (lines starting with `#`)

**Technical Improvements:**
- Complete rewrite with object-oriented architecture
- Type hints throughout the codebase
- Dataclasses for structured data handling
- Better error handling (LifetimeTimeout, EOFError)
- Cleaner executor shutdown on interrupt
- Reduced rate limiting delay (0.1s → 0.05s)

### v2.0.0

**Wordlist Improvements:**
- Massive wordlist upgrade - Took dom.txt from 100 to 600+ subdomains
- Added API variants, cloud infrastructure, IoT endpoints
- Covers auth/security, payment gateways, analytics, CI/CD pipelines
- Way better geo coverage - cities and more countries
- Handles modern cloud-native and microservices setups
- Better database and service discovery hits

### v1.5.0
- Rate limiting so you don't get blocked
- Thread handling works better now
- Doesn't crash on DNS failures anymore
- Prettier output with colors

### v1.0.0
- First drop with the core stuff
- Multi-threaded subdomain scanning
- Filters out Cloudflare IPs
